# Project Title: Hacking a 100 Ohm Differential Pair

## Overview
This project explores the intricacies of PCB interconnect behavior and PCB stack-up parameters to achieve optimal design performance. The primary focus is on understanding the discrepancies between designed parameters and actual fabricated outcomes, specifically for a 100 ohm differential pair.

## Objectives
- Analyze the behavior of interconnects in PCB designs and their impact on signal integrity.
- Investigate the parameters of PCB stack-ups and their influence on board performance.
- Identify and reconcile differences between designed parameters and fabricated outcomes.
- Use simulation data to achieve greater transparency and accuracy in parameter values.

## Methodology
1. **Interconnect Analysis**: Analyzed the interconnects in the PCB design to understand their behavior and how they affect signal integrity and overall board performance.
2. **PCB Stack-up Parameters**: Examined the specific parameters of the PCB stack-up, such as layer thickness, dielectric constant, and spacing, to identify factors that could lead to inconsistencies between the design and the fabricated board.
3. **Fabrication Discrepancies**: Understood closely with the fabrication vendors like JLC PCB to compare the designed parameters with the actual parameters of the fabricated board. Identified potential sources of discrepancies and their impact on the board's performance.
4. **Simulation and Measurement**: Performed detailed simulations using advanced tools to model the behavior of the 100 ohm differential pair. Compared the simulation results with measured data from the fabricated board.
5. **Data Hacking and Transparency**: Implemented techniques to adjust and hack the simulation data to better fit the measured data, thereby improving the accuracy and transparency of the parameter values. This process involved iterative refinement and validation to ensure reliable results.
